# About Me

Hi, I'm Paul, a current computer engineering undergrad you can find _somewhere_ on the Linux command line. 

## Likes

* Languages: C, x86-64 assembly, Python, VHDL.
* Programming paradigms: low-level programming (systems programming, embedded systems), hardware description language programming/digital logic design.
* Miscellaneous: LaTeX and Markdown; Linux (Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali).
* Music: spectacular tracks that I imagine computer programmers would have listened to c. 1975-1988. Stay tuned.

## Current Interests

* Languages: learning C++ and ARM assembly
* Planning: industry and probably graduate school (master's at first, and _maybe_ a PhD)
* Fields in computer science: embedded systems, computer architecture, operating systems, and cybersecurity

# Contacting Me

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, and my institutional address is <paulk@virginia.edu>.

I get a _lot_ of communication at the above address, however. For development-related communication regarding projects hosted on this GitHub or other matters, I'd prefer you reach me at <pdevkarhnak@gmail.com>.
