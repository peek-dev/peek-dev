# About Me

Hi, I'm @peek-dev, a current computer engineering undergrad floating around _somewhere_ in the Mid-Atlantic.

## Likes

* Languages: C, x86-64 assembly, Python, VHDL.
* Programming paradigms: low-level programming (systems programming, embedded systems).
* Miscellaneous: LaTeX and Markdown; Linux (Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali).
* Music: spectacular tracks that I imagine computer programmers would have listened to c. 1976-1988. Stay tuned.

## Current Interests

* Languages: learning C++ and ARM assembly
* Planning: industry and probably graduate school (master's at first, and _maybe_ a PhD)
* Fields in computer science: embedded systems, computer architecture, operating systems, and cybersecurity
